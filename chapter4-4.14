Pre incrementing a variable causes it to be incremented by 1, and then the new value of the variable is used in the expression in which it appears. 
Post incrementing a variable causes the current value of the variable to be used in the expression in which it appears, and then the variableâ€™s value is incremented by 1.
Pre incrementing and post incrementing a variable have the same effect when the incrementing operation appears in a statement by itself.
